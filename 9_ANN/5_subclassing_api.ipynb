You can then compile it, evaluate it and use it to make predictions, exactly like we just did."

    "However, this extra flexibility comes at a cost: your modelâ€™s architecture is hidden within the call() method, so Keras cannot easily inspect it, it cannot save or clone it, and when you call the summary() method, you only get a list of layers, without any information on how they are connected to each other. Moreover, Keras cannot check types and shapes ahead of time, and it is easier to make mistakes. So unless you really need that extra flexibility, you should probably stick to the Sequential API or the Functional API."
